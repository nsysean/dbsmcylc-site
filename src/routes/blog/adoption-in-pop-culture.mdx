Adoption is a deeply human and complex experience. It's a process filled with emotional layers, diverse experiences, and unique stories. Yet, when we look at adoption through the lens of pop culture—television, movies, literature, and social media—we often encounter a surprisingly limited set of narratives and recurring tropes. These portrayals shape our societal perceptions, consciously or unconsciously influencing how we view families created through adoption. In this post, we'll unpack common tropes, examine their impact, and explore how pop culture can move toward richer, more authentic portrayals.


### **Common Adoption Tropes in Pop Culture**

#### **1. "The Heroic Rescue" Narrative**
We've all seen this trope: the adopted child is portrayed primarily as a helpless victim who needs saving, and the adoptive parents are depicted as heroic rescuers. Films like "The Blind Side" or "Instant Family," although well-intentioned and heartwarming, sometimes reinforce this simplistic narrative. While adoption can indeed represent a fresh start, this trope can inadvertently diminish the complexity of adoptees' identities, their biological families, and their own agency.

#### **2. "The Troubled Adoptee"**
Another frequent portrayal is the adoptee as inherently troubled or rebellious. Consider characters like Loki from Marvel's cinematic universe or the troubled adopted teen trope that recurs in countless TV dramas. This stereotype can lead audiences to unconsciously associate adoption with trauma, instability, or behavioral issues, oversimplifying adoptees' experiences and reinforcing harmful assumptions.

#### **3. "The Secret Adoption Revelation"**
Pop culture loves the dramatic reveal. Think Luke Skywalker discovering Darth Vader is his biological father, or the soap opera storyline where a character discovers their adoption papers hidden away. While these plot twists provide great dramatic tension, they perpetuate the idea that adoption is something hidden, shameful, or traumatic—rather than a normal, healthy family-building process.

#### **4. "The Perfectly Happy Ending"**
In contrast to the "troubled adoptee," some portrayals go to the other extreme, creating an overly idealized image of adoption as a magical solution to every problem. While adoption can indeed bring families joy, connection, and fulfillment, depicting adoption as an instant "happy ending" ignores the nuanced emotional journeys families navigate, including loss, identity struggles, and complex family dynamics.

### **Why Do These Tropes Persist?**
Pop culture thrives on simplicity and emotional resonance. These tropes provide easy emotional engagement, drama, and clear narratives. However, when consistently repeated, they create misconceptions, stereotypes, and unrealistic expectations. They can alienate adoptees, adoptive families, and birth families by obscuring the complexity of their experiences and identities.


### **The Impact of Simplified Narratives**
Simplified portrayals not only misrepresent adoption realities, they can also unintentionally harm adoptees’ self-perception. Adoptees who grow up consuming media that reinforces stereotypes might struggle with reconciling their identities, internalize negative assumptions, or feel isolated from their peers. Similarly, adoptive and biological families may find their experiences minimized or distorted by oversimplified portrayals.

### **Moving Towards Authenticity: Positive Examples**
Fortunately, more nuanced portrayals of adoption in pop culture have begun to emerge, providing authentic representation and depth:

- **"This Is Us" (TV Series):** Explores adoption realistically by tackling the complexities of transracial adoption, biological family relationships, and identity struggles. Randall Pearson's journey realistically portrays the multifaceted nature of adoption, including both joy and pain.
- **"Lion" (2016 Film):** A powerful depiction of an adoptee’s search for his birth family, highlighting the emotional complexity and depth of adoptees' identity and belonging.
- **"Anne with an E" (Netflix Series):** Although set in the late 19th century, Anne Shirley's adoption story deals sensitively and authentically with themes of belonging, trauma, and resilience, while avoiding simplistic narratives.

These examples show how pop culture can embrace complexity and authenticity, creating relatable, multidimensional characters who genuinely represent the adoption experience.

### **How Pop Culture Can Do Better: Tips for Authentic Portrayals**
- **Involve Adoptee Voices:** Authentic storytelling begins with genuine, lived experiences. Writers and producers should bring in adoptees and adoption professionals as consultants, writers, and creators.
- **Broaden Adoption Narratives:** Portray diverse experiences—open adoptions, transracial and international adoptions, foster-to-adoption stories, LGBTQ+ families adopting, and adult adoptees reconnecting with birth families.
- **Avoid Simplistic Resolutions:** Adoption stories shouldn't always end perfectly. Allow characters to navigate emotional nuance, explore their identities, and embrace complexity.
- **Normalize Adoption as a Family-Building Choice:** Adoption can be portrayed as a normal, positive, and valid way of forming families, rather than as a dramatic plot twist or sensationalized event.

### **Final Thoughts**
Pop culture shapes our perceptions in profound ways. Adoption portrayals, when handled authentically and thoughtfully, can foster empathy, understanding, and greater societal acceptance. By moving beyond simplistic tropes, we can honor the richness of adoption experiences and positively influence real families navigating their journeys every day.

In the end, pop culture holds immense power to shape our understanding of adoption. Let's embrace this responsibility thoughtfully, creating narratives that celebrate authenticity, diversity, and complexity.
